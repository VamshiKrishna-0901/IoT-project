# Smart Traffic Light Management System ðŸš¦

## Overview
The **Smart Traffic Light Management System** is an innovative solution designed to optimize traffic flow and reduce congestion at intersections. Using infrared (IR) sensors, the system dynamically adjusts traffic signal timings based on real-time vehicle density in each lane.

## Features
- Dynamically adjusts signal timing based on vehicle density.
- Ensures fair allocation of green light time to all lanes.
- Supports scenarios with varying vehicle densities, including no vehicles, high density in one lane, and equal density across all lanes.
- Implements round-robin scheduling to prevent lane starvation.

## Test Cases

### Test Case 1: No Vehicles Present
- **Description:** Test the system when no vehicles are detected.
- **Input:** No IR sensor detects a vehicle.
- **Expected Output:** The traffic signal remains green for the current lane and switches to red after the predefined time interval.

### Test Case 2: One Lane with Vehicles
- **Description:** Test the system when vehicles are detected in only one lane.
- **Input:** One IR sensor detects vehicles, others do not.
- **Expected Output:** The traffic signal should remain green for the lane with vehicles until the vehicles pass or after a maximum green light duration, then switch to the next lane.

### Test Case 3: All Lanes with Vehicles
- **Description:** Test the system when vehicles are detected in all lanes.
- **Input:** All IR sensors detect vehicles.
- **Expected Output:** The traffic signal should prioritize lanes based on vehicle density, giving each lane a green light in a round-robin manner, ensuring no lane is starved.

### Test Case 4: High Vehicle Density in One Lane
- **Description:** Test the system when one lane has a significantly higher vehicle density.
- **Input:** One IR sensor detects high density, others detect low or medium density.
- **Expected Output:** The traffic signal should allocate more green light time to the lane with higher density, while still allowing other lanes to proceed in turn.

### Test Case 5: Equal Vehicle Density in All Lanes
- **Description:** Test the system when all lanes have equal vehicle density.
- **Input:** All IR sensors detect equal vehicle density.
- **Expected Output:** The traffic signal should switch lanes in a round-robin manner, ensuring equal green light time for all lanes.
